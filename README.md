# Badlands
A pipeline for creating training data for U2Net - Taking existing photos without backgrounds, adding a generated fake background, and saving the binary mask of the original image.


Use any dataset of images with an alpha channel (transparent background)


I used: https://github.com/VinAIResearch/CPM#datasets sticker data set on this repo to show examples.

For my actual model training I got images from stickpng.com 

Note that using images from stickpng.com for commercial projects is not allowed.
